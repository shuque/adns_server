# adns_server

This is a fully functional authoritative DNS server written in Python.
It serves DNS zones in master file format. I mainly use it for functional
testing and prototyping new protocol features. It is not intended for
production use or high performance applications.

## DNSSEC Support

The server implements the DNSSEC protocol extensions. It can serve
pre-signed master file format zones, both NSEC and NSEC3 (e.g. zones
generated with an offline signer like BIND's dnssec-signzone). It can
also perform online signing with a combined signing key, using the
[Compact Denial of Existence](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-dnsop-compact-denial-of-existence/) method, using either NSEC or NSEC3, and can also do traditional NSEC3
White Lies.

The 'dnssec: true' parameter must be specified in the configuration file
for signed zones. The 'dynamic_signing: true' and 'private_key: /path/to/privatekey.pem'
options are needed for online signing.

## DELEG Support

The server can support delivery of the
[experimental DELEG record](https://github.com/fl1ger/deleg) in referral
responses, using the private RR type, 65287. DELEG is a newly proposed
mechanism to support extensible delegation capabilities in the DNS, and
is planned to (eventually) replace both the DS and parent-side NS records.
A per zone configuration flag "deleg_enabled" needs to be set to true to use
this feature.

For signed zones, it can currently only be used with the online signing modes.
This is because most tools that generate pre-signed zones won't be able to
deal with a gratuitous "DELEG" record contained in the input. If they accept it,
they will likely treat it as non-authoritative "glue" and not sign it. And a
traditional authoritative server will need additional logic to return it in a
referral response. This program will recognize the DELEG record and will place
it in the referral of the corresponding delegation along with a dynamically
generated signature. (In the future, I may write my own modified zone signer,
after which the program could also serve pre-signed zones with DELEG).

This program also supports returning DELEG from unsigned zones, as well as
DELEG referrals to subzones that aren't signed. The rules for processing
such referrals on the resolver side need to be very carefully spelled out
in the specification to avoid security problems. For example, if a secure
transport capability (e.g. DOT, DOH, DOQ) for a delegated zone needs to be
obtained without DNSSEC, then an alternate means of authenticating the
channel to the server needs to be used (e.g. the delegating parent zone would
need to have pre-configured DNS over TLS/DoH/QUIC and require Internet PKI
authentication of its server certificates).

DELEG supports off-path authentication of a child zone's secure entry point
DNSKEY(s). For this mode of operation, it would be prudent for a validating
resolver to require DNSSEC in the parent zone. Otherwise it would involve
either leap of faith authentication, or authenticating the transport channel
to the delegating server in some way, e.g. with the Internet PKI, which would
allow any Public CA to compromise DNSSEC authentication.

While the protocol details are still being developed, here is a quick summary
of the behavior as currently implemented in this program for signed zones: the
DELEG record is a delegation record that appears in the parent zone, whose
owner name matches the name of the delegated zone, similar to DS, and like the
DS record, it is authoritative in the parent. When a delegation contains both
a DS and DELEG record set, then both are returned in the referral response with
their signatures. When only one of them is present, it is returned along with
the NSEC or NSEC3 record set matching the delegated name (to prove that the other
doesn't exist). Confirming the existence of DELEG capabilities will likely also
need a secure signal via a new DS digest type, or a new DNSKEY flag. Those
signals can be loaded from zone file data.


### Pre-requisites

* Python 3
* Python Cryptography module
* The dnspython module, version 2.3 or greater
* sortedcontainers
* PyYAML module
* siphash module (for DNS cookie support)
* cachetools (for online signature cache)

These can usually be installed via pip:
```
pip install cryptography
pip install 'dnspython>=2.3'
pip install sortedcontainers
pip install pyyaml
pip install siphash
pip install cachetools
```

### Usage

```
$ adns_server.py -h
Reading config from: adnsconfig.yaml
adns_server.py version 0.5.0
Usage: adns_server.py [<Options>]

Options:
       -h:        Print usage string
       -c file:   Configuration file (default 'adnsconfig.yaml')
       -d:        Turn on debugging
       -p N:      Listen on port N (default 53)
       -s A:      Bind to server address A (default wildcard address)
       -u uname:  Drop privileges to UID of specified username
                  (if server started running as root)
       -g group:  Drop provileges to GID of specified groupname
                  (if server started running as root)
       -4:        Use IPv4 only
       -6:        Use IPv6 only
       -f:        Remain attached to foreground (default don't)
       -e N:      Max EDNS bufsize in octets for responses we send out.
                  (-e 0 will disable EDNS support)

Note: a configuration file that minimally specifies the zones to load
must be present.
```

### Configuration file

An example configuration file looks like the following. At a minimum
it needs so specify the "zones:" section, defining the zone names and
zone files for each zone that the server will serve.

The configuration file supports additional options beyond what can
be specified via command line switches. Such as contents of the NSID
option, DNSSEC parameters, etc.

```
config:
  port: 5309
  user: "named"
  group: "named"
  edns: 1432
  minimal_any: false
  nsid: "dnstest.example.com"
zones:
  - name: "example.com"
    file: "zonefile.example"
  - name: "signedzone.com"
    dnssec: true
    file: "zonefile.signedzone"
  - name "onlinesigning.com"
    dnssec: true
    file "zonefile.onlinesigning"
    dynamic_signing: true
    private_key: "/path/to/privatekey.pem"
```

### Key Generation for Online Signing

This repo also includes a small script, genkey.pl, to help generate
DNSSEC keys used for online signing configurations.

```
$ ./genkey.py -h
usage: genkey.py [-h] [-a N] [-f N] zone

positional arguments:
  zone        DNS zone name

optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
  -a N        DNSSEC algorithm number (default: 13)
  -f N        Value of DNSKEY flags field (default: 257)
  ```

  An example usage to generate an ECDSA NIST P256 (algorithm 13)
  key for example.com follows.

  ```
  $ ./genkey.py example.com
